### Hi there üëãüèΩ

I'm currently writing my first book, Afrocentury, but I still regularly contribute to various projects that I maintain.
Some that may be of interest to you include:
- [Stipple Effect](https://github.com/jbunke/stipple-effect), a pixel art editor and animator
- [Translation](https://github.com/jbunke/translation), a simple platforming physics game with a level editor
- [Delta Time](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time), library for Java game and GUI program development
- [Wordle+](https://github.com/jbunke/wordle-plus), my implementation of Wordle, extended to optionally play with 4-, 6-, and 7-letter English words
- [Flash Fluency](https://github.com/jbunke/flashfluency), a spaced repetition text-based flashcard program

You can download my published games [here](https://flinkerflitzer.itch.io/) and hire me to make a game or write software for you [here](https://www.fiverr.com/jordanbunke).

The best way to get in touch with me is via email :)
