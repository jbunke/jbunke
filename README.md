### Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently working on:
* [*Top Down Sprite Maker (TDSM)*](https://github.com/jbunke/tdsm), a pixel art character customization program that supports multiple sprite styles
* [*Stipple Effect*](https://github.com/stipple-effect/stipple-effect), a pixel art editor with animation capabilities and a rich scripting ecosystem

Both *TDSM* and *Stipple Effect* use [*DeltaScript*](https://github.com/jbunke/deltascript) as their scripting language, which I designed and implemented myself.

You can find out more about my work on [my website](https://jbunke.github.io).
