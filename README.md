I am currently working on [Stipple Effect](https://github.com/jbunke/stipple-effect), a pixel art editor with animation capabilities and a rich scripting ecosystem.

You can download my published games and software [here](https://flinkerflitzer.itch.io/).

The best way to get in touch with me is via email :)
